I am a Psychology PhD student at the Univeristy of York working in the EMERALD Lab. 

Prior to starting my PhD programme, i was at the University of Goldsmiths where i completed my Masters Degree in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience where i conducted research looking at jump-scares and film theory (my research areas are VERY broad). 

The Univeristy of Exeter is where i really got my foot in the door with what i wanted to do, i completed my Undergraduate Degree there 2016-2019 in Sport and Excercise Science with Medical Studies. My very first (first author) publication was actually my undergraduate dissertation and my mentor was my supervisor at the time who inspired me to pursue this career path.

My journey in academia has been a unique but incredibly rewarding experience.
